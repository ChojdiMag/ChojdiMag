# Hi, I'm Magdalena! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a scientist with a passion for machine learning and data analysis.
For the past 5 years, I have been involved in data analysis at a scientific research institution. My main occupation is conducting brake system tests and endurance tests along with analyses and compilation of results. I use Python on a daily basis with an emphasis on Pandas and Numpy. I create elaborate reports in Power Bi. In addition, I am constantly developing my skills. I participate in numerous courses. After work I take care of two dogs, who are very demanding, not to be confused with spoiled ;-)
